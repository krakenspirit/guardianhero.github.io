  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Guardian Hero Nation is a Traveling Monastery that began its roots under the name "Zenratstudios", a start-up game studio and book publishing platform that aspired to offer a way to gamify social impact. During the time the concept of the "Hero Challenge" was developed, inspired by the 1 million dollar homepage. The goal was to have people nominate heroes (nonprofits) in their local community, where they would be hosted on our page. At the end of the fundraiser all Heroes would receive a portion of income with the most voted Heroes being pushed to the top of the page. After the fundraiser those who were on the 1 million page would continue to receive income for their projects for the rest of the duration of our organization. At the time digital currency was seen as a way to capture and distribute the profit of our revenue to non-profits and social entrepreneurs. Anyone could be nominated as long as they had come together to do something good be it for animals or people.</p>
<p>The challenge had a lot of potential but never took off. Behind the scenes the concept of the Hero Challenge was evolved into a business model. In that model gardeners could get Hero Points (HP) whenever they performed social actions (growing plants and donating plants to the organization, which we then would deliver online or transport as part of a food bus to food deserts and low-income individuals who did not have transportation). To make it sustainable a low-cost membership was required similar to Costco's model, though there was an option to acquire membership through donations. The profit we gained would be called "GP" Guardian points a portion of which was distributed back as Hero Points. HP could be used for food, to pay rent, and a number of other things. So the more money generated, the more HP we could offer to those who were kind. The rest of the money would be used to fund the Guardians who ran the back-end portion.  The idea was to eventually create an alternative form of Universal Income that expanded the more people used the platform.</p>
<p>That project never quite took off  but gave birth to the Guardian Monastery, it's philosophy and the first Guardian to emerge from it all, S.K Murghein ("Yugen Skye").  Today Guardian Hero Nation is nothing more than a journey to be and build a walking monastery (a.k.a. "Traveling Monastery"), a monastery with no physical roots that travels with the person until such roots are placed.</p>
<p>On this website you will find an eclectic smorgasbord of interrelated projects all under the same Guardian umbrella.</p>
<p>You will find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Guardian Philosophy that defines 'my' life, the guardian ("parkour") monastery I am learning to build both within myself (the "walking monastery" part), and the impacts it has on others.</li>
<br>
<li>My individual journey ("The walking monastery") or at the very least pictures and captions of my travels, growth, and expansion perhaps even videos too in time.</li>
<br>
<li>As well as other projects that are still being developed back-end. Biocomposting project that may eventually grow into some smaller version of the original garden goal.</li>
<br>
<li>The Guardian Sanctuary, the part of the Monastery that hosts animals and children and helps them heal, gain experiences. At the present time the "Heroes" in my concept are now children, who will receive a source of income, care and skills.</li>
<br>
<li>My Creative works be they books, movies or games and the works of other Guardians as the numbers grow, under the guise of Zenratstudios.</li>
<br>
<li>Last but not least you will find an experimental GH team. The idea is to build a team of low-income people who have great skills, be it writing, or programming, and to bring it together to form a group of people who go out and write  content, build and consult websites for other people. It's experimental because the types of services offered and the ability to actually promote ourselves, network and freelance is a bit up in the air. This team doesn't exist yet, so you'll find it to be mostly empty.</li>
</ul><p>At the end of the day I am building something that is my life's work and mission. This website documents the progress and success of that mission, without depending on people to support it. All the money I generate goes into transforming a Walking Monastery into Headquarters that will provide for some kind of Hero who will impact their local community in positive ways.</p>
