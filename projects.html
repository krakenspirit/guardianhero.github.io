    <b>What is The Guardian & Hero Economy?</b><br></center>
    The Guardian & Hero Economy is a social experiment and cryptocurrency project that aims to provide UBI utilizing existing cryptocurrency models. It aims to be Wall Street made for the people by the people. Where Wall Street has become synonymous with commercial and financial success. The premise is simple and has been done successfully before albeit without the intent of UBI: <br><br>
    
    An Organization accumulates revenue [from services, income, fees, donations] and holds it in a proof-of-stake wallet (like a bank generating interest). To diversify profits are placed into a currency basket, filled with proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies whose value is driven by speculative interest and who also generate interest. The dividends are then shared and distributed to qualifying participants in the form of Tokens.  UBI  is thus generated from a combination of Income, Financial Speculation and Transaction Fees, which is then distributed to participants from dividends based on a Proof-of-Participation (Proof-of-Importance) Model.
    <br><br>
    Examples of distribution models include:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend</b> -25% of revenue generated from oil is placed in a fund, which is in turn invested into various stocks, bonds, and other equity. The interest earnings are distributed to Alaskan Residents every September ranging between 1,000-2,000/year, with the checks flucuating based on the value. It has been successful reducing poverty up to 20%. </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Basic Attention Token - </b> Users are paid to view ads receiving 70% while the remaining 30% goes to the browser's developers, users on average generate per year $60-$70 but could earn as much as $224/year or more with value of the token increases. They encourage Users to use the tokens to tip websites and in the future may be used to purchase web content. They allow users to cash out if they desire and it is not required that they participate though encouraged. The main BAT users are Publishers, Advertisers, and Users, with BAT distributing profit to everyone. Users mine BAT tokens with their "attention" while surfing the internet and accepting ADs. While BAT is not the 'first' organization to pay people to view ads (ex. SwagBucks and similar). They are the first to incorporate the experience with everyday action while protecting user privacy and data, instead of selling it. BAT is the most successful example of what Universal Basic Income can look like when integrated with everyday actions. </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Other - </b> Other tokens attempted to pay users for engaging on their website, Steemit, Storj, Lbry coin. And still more incentivize users through Proof-Of-Stake, Proof-of-Work, Dividend Stocks, and more all provide examples of either profit sharing or dividends in exchange for a desirable transaction on the network (either by securing the network, sharing storage, offering their attention and more). The only difference between the other tokens and BAT is that with BAT you didn't need money to join and it didn't require such as steemit to write or engage with comments - just to let Ads shine through on your phone while also protecting your privacy.
        </li>
    </ul>

            <center><b>Contracts and Currency</b></center>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Guardian & Hero Nation (Cerberus Contract)</b> - When Participants interact with 1 of 4 delegate contracts, the delegate sends the cryptocurrency to Cerebrus who stakes the crypto and produces GP. It checks transactions to determine how much GP to print which it then divvies between the 4 contracts, the Participant and Receiver. In addition it keeps track of pay-it-forward transactions. This is where for every transaction where a Participant sends or stakes something, two previous transactions are given a portion of the fee, with the remainder fee being sent at random to 1 of the 4 remaining wallets. Users can adjust their fees accordingly and decide the distribution.
                </li><br>
                <br>
                <li><b>Hero Wallet (Prometheus) </b>- Prometheus Contracts are interacted with during Fundraisers and Donations. When Users interact with a Prometheus contract, the User adjusts their distributions, sending a percentage that they want Prometheus Contracts to keep and deciding where and of what percentages they want the remaining distributions to go. There is a minimum distribution requirement on all acounts, and it is similar to the fee structure of miners. Prometheus then sends money given to it to Cerebrus in exchange for GP tokens. When GP tokens are staked by default they produce Hero Points (HP) but they can be switched to produce Guardian Points (GP) by individual wallets, or allow for a combination of HP and GP. Prometheus Contracts also check the status of Heroes to see if they are Nominated and if they have received Hero Status or not. Nominated Heroes have a wallet generated for them, HP is then distributed to these wallets and donated or given as regular grants to Heroes with Hero Status. If the Hero loses Hero Status which is verified through their wallet, then their organization stops receiving the grants.
                </li><br>

                <li><b>Guardian Wallet (Medusa)</b> - Medusa Contracts are non-profit developer wallets that receive revenue whenever Users interact with other contracts in the form of business related income. Revenue is used to further develop the system. Medusa Contracts by default stake the income and distribute the dividends in the form of either GP by default but can be switched to HP by individual wallets, or allow for a combination of HP and GP. 
                </li><br>

                <li><b>Sidekick Wallet (Enkidu) </b>- Enkidu Contracts dubbed Enki for short are named after Gilgamesh's sidekick. They are participants who want to do good in the world but also need food to eat. These Users interact with the Prometheus Contract whenever they wish to nominate. Everytime a Sidekick transacts or donates to any of the 4 contracts they receive a Participation Score, and a portion of their donation is returned as Guardian Points by the Cerebrus Contract. Enkidu stores the GP and the dividends produced as HP are distributed to all sidekicks based on their Participation Score. In the future other ways to participate will include purchasing NFTs produced by the Guardian & Hero Nation, playing games and utilizing projects developed by the Guardian & Hero Nation, and just all around supporting the organization with their patronage and attention. Those with Higher Score Points have more weight added to their vote and receive greater distribution of allocation. Participation is not measured in how much you give, but instead is calculated on a number of factors similar to NEMs Proof-of-Importance models, which rewards people for being part of the community.
                </li><br>
                <li><b>Underdog Wallets (Atlas)-</b> These Contracts are named after the God Atlas, who during the war against the Gods was condemned to hold the world on his shoulders. Users who interact with these wallets are sponsored by non-profit organizations. They are designed to help children in orphanages or who have outgrown foster care, aftercare victims of human trafficking, sickly animals, children and adults who need surgeries but can't afford them and people who have mental illnesses or other major health concerns but can't afford them. Everytime Users interact in any of the 4 Contracts they have an option to allocate a number of resources to the Atlas contract. There are no conditions, restrictions or limitations on the Atlas Contract, all Users on the Atlas Contract can start with nothing and overtime accumulate resources. Users who participate more eventually get promoted to Sidekick Wallets, and receive Score Points.
                </li><br>
                <li><b>Guardian Points (GP)</b> - Guardian Points represent business related income and is a currency that can only be donated between contracts and staked. They are designed so that a portion of value always remains in the network helping it to develop, grow and expand. GP can be burned and converted into HP to be redeemed for ADA through Cerebrus. </li><br>
                <li><b>Hero Points (HP)</b> - Hero Points represent dividends, shared revenue and expenses, they are owned by the receiver and can be taken outside of the network are used as a form of currency by people within the network who accept it as currency. HP can be directly redeemed for ADA through the Cerebrus contract. </li>

            </ol>

            The goal of this experiment is to provide community supported UBI that lifts participants out of poverty and transforms the current economic system where only the 1% have wealth; into 40%-90% of the population is wealthy and successful. As the wallets grow the UBI should be able to provide more, with the more people transact the more the dividends grow.

The ideal method would be to launch a custom blockchain as opposed to running it as a Smart Contract, but the easier method would be to deploy it as a Contract on a secured network, and then as the project grows eventually convert it into it's own blockchain.

                    In Phase-1 an initial Fundraiser will be launched using colored tokens on a blockchain that accepts those tokens (or) using Cardano (ADA) with the proceeds being staked and distributed as ADA. Fundraisers will become regular once certain milestones are reached, with the aim of adding 100 Heroes every year until a goal of 1 Million Heroes (or) 1 Million Fundraisers have been reached. Money raised during Phase-1 would be used to develop the network. Phase-1 fundraisers act as prototypes. In Phase-2 the blockchain or smartchain and subsequent wallets related to the 5 contracts would be completed. Phase-2 fundraisers and future fundraisers thereafter will occur on an annual or semi-annual basis.
                    <br<br>
                    During Phase-1 Fundraisers a maximum of 100 Non-profits are selected in either a Human or Animal Category. Participants must then Nominate their chosen non-profit to help it enter into Hero Status. To do so, they select a bag of GP tokens ranging in value between $1, $5 and $100 priced in cryptocurrency. Once a Nominated Hero has reached $10,000 valued in GP, they achieve Hero Status. Their funds are pooled into the Hero Wallet and distributed as redeemable "HP" to Heroes with Hero Status. When a Pool becomes saturated a new Hero Wallet is generated and distributed to the next group of 100 Heroes during the next Fundraiser and campaign. <br><br>
                     During the campaign funds are divided between Staking Pools grouped into Hero, Guardian and Sidekick. When the Sidekick Pool reaches the milestone of 1,000,000 the fundraiser stops. Dividends produced by the One Million Heroes wallet will be made available to Heroes who maintain Hero Status and can be redeemed monthly. Hero Status is maintained so long as the organization is not associated with abuses of power and can prove they've used their resources to directly benefit the people and animals they help. The Fundraiser will run annually.<br><br>

          <center><b>How to Purchase HP and GP</b></center>
        During Phase-1 Tokens will only be distributed during One Million Heroes Campaigns, these are non-profit fundraisers that nominates Hero Wallets until they accumulate enough funds to achieve Hero Status. Once Hero Status is received the Heroes GP will be staked and they will begin receiving monthly to annual HP. As the value of the reserve increases, so does the value of their monthly distribution which is then donated to each network to do with as they please, so long as the HP is used for their non-profit. Whether these are called 'Grants' or 'Donations' remains a penny in the air.
        <br><br>
        When the Cerebrus Contract is built, during campaigns Participants whose nominated Heroes receive or received Hero Status will also begin to receive UBI whether or not they hold GP in their wallets. In order to continue receiving UBI Participants have to participate in the economy. Overtime there will be more ways to participate than just nominating a Hero or Donating during fundraisers, with eventual services being added.
        <br><br>
        <b>How it works:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Purchase ADA with Fiat on an exchange or Exchange a Cryptocurrency for ADA from your chosen exchange
            </li>
            <li>Exchange ADA for Guardian Points (GP) distributed by Guardians on guardianhero.cypto or guardianhero.org </li>
            <li>Vote or Nominate a Hero during the campaign by sending GP to Hero Wallets* designated to nominee or Hero (you cannot stake your GP without first nominating a Hero or donating to a Hero)</li>               
            <li>Once a Hero Wallet has reached a minimum of 10,000GP the nominee becomes a Hero </li>
            <li>Hero Status* allows GP to be staked in order to receive HP </li><br><br>
            <li>Once one or more Heroes you Nominated receives Hero Status, participants using Sidekick Wallets* can stake GP in exchange for HP</li>
            Notes:
            <ul>
                *Exchange fees will be distributed to one of the Guardian Wallets.<br><br>
                *Hero Wallets and Guardian Wallets function as stake pools which distribute UBI <br><br>
                *All Nominated Heroes will remain in nominated status until they reach Hero Status.<br><br>
                *Only Participants who have Nominated a Hero can receive income distributed from the GHN Wallet without staking. UBI is restricted to those who participate in the network.

        <h5>Part 3: Roadmap & Whitepaper</h5>
        Coming Soon
    </center>
    Above is the concept for a cryptocurrency concept designed to be UBI. Please give feedback, ask questions, find flaws, pinpoint alternative solutions and just overall rip apart. 
    <ul>
        <li>Could it work, why or why not?</li>
        <li>What are potential sore points and how could it be designed to be simpler or better?</li>
        <li>What are some ways to design a censorship resistant currency designed around staking, dividends and profit-sharing?</li>
        <li>How to build trust if it has to start out centralized - does it have to start out centralized?</li>
        <li>How to afford Rocket Proof Smart Contract code if it is to be decentralized off the bat without funding</li>
        <li>One particular question is how many people could 15 Million support. With each milestone how many could it help and would a cap on participants need to be had in the beginning?</li>
        <li>Who to hire to design it and teach us how to deploy if designing is outside our scope?</li>
        <li>What blockchain to use, should it be custom, or is a smart contract on an existing blockchain better?</li>
    </ul>
    The idea of naming the contracts of Gods instead of after the actual participant groups; is simply because this is an experiment. What if Guardian & Hero Nation as a community fractures with different groups going their separate ways to build their own organization but utilizing the same or similar code. What if our community experiment is successful enough that we don't other people build it, and do so better? What if for whatever reason the Guardian Developers decide to pass the baton to Heroes or Sidekicks or the community overall and they want to rebrand to Heroes & Sidekicks, Guardians & Underdogs, so, that's why the Contracts aren't named as the groups they represent.
