//SuperAgent & Axios: I prefer Axios, but the problem is that "request is not defined" and I don't know the equivalent for js. We can use "Require.Js" which would give us 3 dependencies just to use AJAX. that's a bit overkill.

//Fetch and/or Jquery.Ajax are your only options here.

/*Controller.js is for 'form routing' Any
forms on the front page will be routed to the
back-end Flask Controller here with the exception of
"CHART.js"*/
