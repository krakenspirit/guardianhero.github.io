            Guardian & Hero Nation is a blueprint for a nomadic, self-sufficient, monastic village. Members travel by horse and wagon, cargo ebikes and tents, and other portable tiny homes and migrate to places where they wild camp in groups among the wilds of nature away from organized campsites. They generate their own electricity, grow food, collect rainwater and work together to build or acquire homes for each other.

        </div>
        
        
        <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
            <b>Guardians</b> are eclectic Buddhists, Pagans and Shamans. While each Guardian has their own beliefs, they share a set of overlapping beliefs that allow them to achieve a common goal and share a lifestyle.          
            All Guardians are called Monks, they practice celibacy as the abstination of marriage to any one individual, instead marrying themselves to the divine, higher consciousness and purpose. They receive a living allowane or stipend and         
            take a vow of poverty, supporting themselves by providing products and services in alignment with their philosophies and then         
            reinvest their profits into building and sustaining the Guardian & Hero Nation.

        <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
            <b>Heroes</b> are layman, they share overlapping beliefs with the Guardians but do not take a vow of poverty or practice celibacy. They provide products and services in alignment with philosophies that are unique to themselves while also serving others. They may donate a portion of their profits to the Guardian & Hero Nation, but keep a greater portion of income for themselves. The majority of layman are independent and self-supporting, but some make arrangements that allow them to be supported by the Guardians without taking monastic vows.

        <div class="cell small-12 textpadding">
            <center><h5>Other Members of the Nation</h5></center><br>
            Guardian's & Heroes work together to help two classes of people. Allies and Underdogs. There have been many proposed systems for helping the community here is the current concept:
            <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
                <b>Allies</b> are members who do not share the same philsophies and beliefs that the Guardians & Heroes do, but support their work by purchasing products and services because they enjoy them. Whenever they make a transaction on a product or service, two previous transactions receive rewards from the succeeding transaction, and the remaining transaction is divided between the Guardians and the Community funds producing dividends. Each person transacting has a participation score, and receive rewards in the form of tokens called Hero Points (HP). These tokens have a value which represent the community's total funds and the dividends produced by it. People with HP could either cash it out as a potential form of Universal Basic Income (if successful) or use it to receive a free and portable house, water or portable food garden.
            </div>

            <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
                <b>Underdogs</b> are members who are low income and live below poverty wage but do not have the financial power to purchase products and services. They receive products and services for free or at a lower cost in relation to their income, in exchange that they pay-it-forward by transacting on or within the network.
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="cell small-12 textpadding">
            <center><h5>What is the Guardian & Hero Economy?</h5></center><br>
            Guardian's reinvest their income into building a portable, self-sustaining village, and store the rest into dividend producing cryptocurrencies and digital assets such as ADA and royalties. The dividends produced are used to build the monastery and services to the public associated with the monastery, what remains after that is then redistributed as living allowance to monastics, layman and community members.
            <br><br>
            
        </div>

        <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
            <b>Community Service - </b> Guardians & Heroes are committed to solving poverty. The Guardian's utilize a profit sharing, pay-it-forward model. In this model, the monastery divides its revenue and shares profits with people who have a high pay-it-forward score. This is done by splitting the income received from products and services into separate funds each producing dividends. One fund is for the monastic members who provide the services, and the other fund is for the community to provide a solution for poverty. <br><br>
            <br><br>

        </div>

        <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
            <b>Products - </b> Guardian's are largely artisans and developers. They work to create games, books and websites that represent their artistic visions. They reinvest their revenue to build portable climate controlled, robotic gardens and water generators, as well as to build or buy wagons, bamboo ebikes and potential livestock.
        </div>

        While providing HP as a form of income (UBI) is one way we've thought of helping others, another way is to reinvest community profit into portable: gardens, atmospheric water generators, and tiny homes that are developed and donated to people instead. The idea is that in the first stages of generating profit we would focus on learning skills and developing solutions that solve our problems. Once a solution is developed and tested, and if it works out, we could then raise funds to do the same for others.<br><br>All of this depends on if the monastics ever achieve financial success however, and it is quite possible that the Monastics never pick up steam and predominately exist as a small band of traveling monks with big dreams, but small yet complete lives.
