            Guardian & Hero Nation is a blueprint for a nomadic, self-sufficient, monastic village. Members travel by horse and wagon, pack and draft animals, cargo ebikes and tents, and other portable tiny homes and migrate to places where they wild camp in groups among the wilds of nature away from organized campsites and cities. They generate their own electricity, grow food, collect rainwater and work together to build or acquire portable, tiny, sustainable homes and the means to transport them from one place to another.

        <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
            <b>Guardians</b> are eclectic Buddhists, Pagans and Shamans. While each Guardian has their own beliefs, they share a set of overlapping beliefs that allow them to achieve a common goal and share a lifestyle.          
            All Guardians are called Monks, they practice celibacy as the abstination of marriage to any one individual, instead marrying themselves to the divine, higher consciousness and purpose. They receive a living allowance or stipend and         
            take a vow of poverty, supporting themselves by providing products and services in alignment with their philosophies and then         
            reinvest their profits into building and sustaining the Guardian & Hero Nation.

        <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
            <b>Heroes</b> are layman, they share overlapping beliefs with the Guardians but do not take a vow of poverty or practice celibacy. They provide products and services in alignment with philosophies that are unique to themselves while also serving others. They may donate a portion of their profits to the Guardian & Hero Nation, but keep a greater portion of income for themselves. The majority of layman are independent and self-supporting, but some make arrangements that allow them to be supported by the Guardians without taking monastic vows.

        <div class="cell small-12 textpadding">
            <center><h5>Other Members of the Nation</h5></center><br>
            Guardian's & Heroes work together to help community members referred to as allies. Allies are broken into two groups of people: Sidekicks and Underdogs. There have been many proposed systems for helping members of the community here is the current concept:
            <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
                <b>Sidekicks</b> are members who do not share the same philsophies and beliefs that the Guardians & Heroes do, but support their work by purchasing products and services because they enjoy them. Whenever they make a transaction on a product or service, two previous transactions receive rewards from the succeeding transaction, and the remaining transaction is divided between the Guardians and the Community funds producing dividends. Each person transacting has a participation score, and receive rewards in the form of tokens called Hero Points (HP). These tokens have a value which represent the community's total funds and the dividends produced by it. People with HP could either cash it out as a potential form of Universal Basic Income or use it to receive a portable house, food or water system. Another alternative proposed has been to use the community funds to build low-cost and safe self-sustainable communities that allow people who have acquired and hold HP to live there.
            </div>

            <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
                <b>Underdogs</b> are members who are low income and live below poverty wage but do not have the financial power to purchase products and services. They receive products and community services for free or at a lower cost in relation to their income, in exchange that they pay-it-forward by transacting on or within the network. The theory is that by providing resources such as tiny homes for free to those who need it, the community members will then be in a position where they can participate in the Guardian & Hero Ecosystem. The better off Underdogs are the more services or products they would be able to purchase, the more income the community funds would receive to invest into self-sustaining communities.
            </div>

            Each housing project built would be local. Some communities might be nomadic in nature while others might be stationary depending on the culture and group, the vast majority of these communities would be placed on purchased land, but we have not ruled out well-developed "shanty" towns, financially supported by the Guardian & Hero Economy that could be easily rebuilt, moved and relocated as necessary. With enough community and government support such towns could become middle and upper class suburbs.
            <br><br>                
            Note that communities are egalitarian in nature and non-denominational. Sidekicks and Underdogs would share the same communities and there would be no segregration based on participation. Communities would be diverse and inclusive. Those who would opt to join the communities would share no common creed or covenant except by regional circumstance, they would agree that each person is free to responsibly search for meaning and truth, where responsiblity is defined as not causing harm or trying to force others to share in the same beliefs, this includes trying to 'convert' others to their belief systems.
        </div>


        <div class="cell small-12 textpadding">
            <center><h5>What is the Guardian & Hero Economy?</h5></center><br>
            Guardian's reinvest their income into building a portable, self-sustaining village to support themselves, and store the rest into dividend producing cryptocurrencies and digital assets such as ADA and royalties. The dividends produced are used to build the monastery and services to the public associated with the monastery, what remains after that is then redistributed as living allowance to monastics, layman and community members.
            <br><br>
            
        </div>

        <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
            <b>Community Service - </b> Guardians & Heroes are committed to solving poverty and unequal wealth distribution. The Guardian's utilize a profit sharing, pay-it-forward model. In this model, the monastery divides its revenue and shares profits with people who have a high pay-it-forward score. This is done by splitting the income received from products and services into separate funds each producing dividends. One fund is for the monastic members who provide the services, and the other fund is for the community to provide a solution for poverty. <br><br>

        </div>

        <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
            <b>Products - </b> Guardian's are largely artisans and developers. They work to create games, books, technology and websites that represent their artistic visions. They reinvest a large portion of their revenue to building portable climate controlled, robotic and non-robotic gardens and water generators, off-grid energy and hotspots, as well as to build or buy wagons, bamboo ebikes and potential livestock. In time the products and services the monastic community will include more than just digital media but actual physical products and services offered locally.
        </div>

        While providing HP as a form of Universal Basic Income is one way we've thought of helping others, another way is to reinvest community profit into portable: energy, hotspots, gardens, atmospheric water generators, and tiny homes that are developed and donated to people as part of safe, community housing projects. The idea is that in the first stages of generating profit Monastics would focus on learning skills and developing solutions that solve our own problems trying to live self-sufficiently. Once a solution is developed and tested, and if it works out, we could then raise funds to do the same for others.<br><br>
        Being able to help the community depends on financial success in some form, be it through selling products and services, and using our lifestyle as a prototype, or launching fundraisers such as One Million Hero campaigns, that sell ad space for nonprofits, social entrepreneurs and/or Digital Tokens as a means to fund our vision. It is quite possible that the Monastics never pick up steam and predominately exist as a small band of traveling monks & artisans with big dreams that never extend beyond themselves, an achievement in and of itself.
