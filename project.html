                Welcome to the Guardian & Hero Nation a start-up international organization dedicated to providing a spiritual, self-sufficient and sustainable lifestyle for Agnostics who identify as eclectic pagans, neo-shamans, and Buddhists. We are a federation of monasteries with a shared vision of living a lifestyle similar to pastoral nomads and regenerative gardeners, with technology integrated into our workflow and trade.  We focus inward and live in harmony with nature and use sustainable practices to support our community.  
            <p>
                At our monastery, we believe in living in harmony with nature and using sustainable practices to support our community. We are artisans, developers and programmers skilled in carpentry, traditional shelters, horticulture and animal husbandry, which allows us to live a self-sufficient lifestyle. We also publish games, books, and art that reflect our values and beliefs.
            <p>
                Our community is made up of individuals who have chosen to live a life dedicated to spiritual growth and service to others. We believe in creating a supportive and nurturing environment where individuals can explore their spirituality and connect with others on a similar path.
            <p>
                We offer a supportive and nurturing environment to connect with like-minded individuals. Our lifestyle emphasizes simplicity, mindfulness, and self-awareness, providing purpose and meaning. Learn new skills and contribute to our sustainable community. Experience a slower pace of life, away from stress, and live a spiritual and fulfilling life.
            <p>
                If you are looking for a community of like-minded individuals who are committed to spiritual growth and sustainable living, we invite you to join us as we develop our monastery. Discover a supportive, harmonious, and sustainable lifestyle that fosters spiritual growth, personal development and service to others. We look forward to connecting with you and sharing our vision for a more harmonious and sustainable life.
