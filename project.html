            Guardian & Hero Nation is a start-up federation of monastaries and microvillages who share a set of common ideals, beliefs and philosophy's, in addition to, funding, resources, mutual support, networked businesses and more. To us "Our life is a byproduct of our healing", with each monastery developing products or services as a result of our own healing. We believe we can create healthier communities, by working on our own healing and growth. As we heal, grow and unfold into being the work we create to help others within our communities and the people we come into contact with are impacted in positive ways.

            <center><h5>How we came to be</h5></center><br>
            Guardian & Hero Nation was founded in (2018) as a spinoff of Zenratstudios (2015) and it's One Million Heroes campaign. Zenratstudios in turn was an attempt by one monk to generate revenue for a Book and Game series that had been in development since (2005). Today Guardian & Hero Nation is a monastery that develops Art and designs self-sustaining communities built with the intent of supporting it's members in a way that aligns with the philosophy we live by: That our life and art is a direct byproduct of our healing. Many people ask who the Guardians and Heroes are and what we believe. Our primary philosophy is to heal ourselves and let our life's work be a byproduct of our healing, to build positive communities for  children to grow, safe places for seniors to age, and to create art that grants some insight into the human condition and a souls ability to heal. Below is the breakdown of some of projects we're working on:
            <p>

            <center><h5>I.</h5></center>
            <center><h5>Book, Game & Art<br> Publishing Studio</h5></center>
            <b>The Medusa project</b> (often dubbed the Compassion Project), is the first project to be produced by the studio. It began as a book and interactive novel written in 2006. Over 17 years as of 2023 it has grown into a series, with a developed lore, characters and universe. The project has gone through several different demos and iterations, but the main constant has been the world, characters and story which has only grown more refined with time. 2022 is the first year the project has become refined enough to share with others interested in it's journey.

            <center><h5>Networked Monastries</h5></center>
            We are working on building a decentralized network of monasteries with a distributed decision making process. This means, every monastery and microvillage part of the nation is independent and interconnected with each other. And that no single authority controls the monastery on a community level. To the degree that there is centralization, The Guardian & Hero Nation serves as both the temple and hub which unites the common goals and monasteries together through a shared vision. It offers guidelines and tenants that each Monastery agrees to, to be part of the Nation and gain access to shared resources. Monasteries are built on the foundation of being cooperative, like co-ops and do not compete with each other. Each individuals success, uplifts the whole. Much of the Nation is centered around reciprocal support, where no one monastery holds the entire weight of another. Each is self-supporting, yet each create an interconnected whole which together form the Guardian & Hero Nation. <p>
            
            Those who share the same core tenants (philosophies, beliefs and spiritual lineage) are part of the Nation. Those who no longer follow the tenants can choose to  leave the Nation at anytime. Monasteries are designed as self-sufficient microvillages, which provide for the care of children, elderly and each other within the monastery, and provide spiritual services in accordance with our shared tenants. Monastic communities build their own houses and provide training to those in the nation to build homes. Monastic communities depend on the skillset of that monastery, with homes being: Tipis, Yurts, Wagons, and other non-traditional housing that we are skilled to build using our local resources. In addition, we work to grow our own food, networking our food resources with each other. We create horse and ebike communities where a car is not needed to move around, and wherein all, or most of, our needs are met. We work to rely less on requiring money to survive and more on strengthening our network of skills. For example: Some members receive training in the medical field and provide these services to our members.<p>
            Each Monastery develops a product, trade or service and shares those skills between monasteries. The services and products each monastery provide are unique to the needs and skillsets of that monastery. These products and services are created from local services and shared freely between nations and members and may contribute to the overall economy of the nation.
