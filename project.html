            Guardian & Hero Nation was founded in (2018) as a spinoff of Zenratstudios (2015) and it's One Million Heroes campaign. Zenratstudios in turn was an attempt by one monk to generate revenue for a Book and Game series that had been in development since (2005). Today Guardian & Hero Nation is a monastery that develops Art and designs self-sustaining communities built with the intent of supporting it's members in a way that aligns with the philosophy we live by: That our life and art is a direct byproduct of our healing. Many people ask who the Guardians and Heroes are and what we believe. Our primary philosophy is to heal ourselves and let our life's work be a byproduct of our healing, to build positive communities for  children to grow, safe places for seniors to age, and to create art that grants some insight into the human condition and a souls ability to heal. Below is the breakdown of projects we're working on:
            <p>

            The Medusa project, began as a book and interactive novel written in 2006. Over 17 years as of 2023 it has grown into a series, with a developed lore, characters and universe. The project has gone through several different demos and iterations, but the main constant has been the world, characters and story which has only grown more refined with time. 2022 is the first year the project has become refined enough to share with others interested in it's journey.

            Guardian & Hero Nation is a startup Monastery for guardian monks and layman who share the same spiritual lineage. The seeds of it began from the same seeds that birthed the Medusa Project, and arose from a desire to build a world that lived beyond the pages of a story. The Monastery is our headquarters, our sangha, home and studio the place (or places) where all the work for this project gets done. It is our culture, our lifestyle and more. We began as a branch of Mahayana Buddhism and morphed into a group of eclectic pagans and neoshamans heavily influenced by buddhist teachings. We aspire to be pastoral nomads and farmers who develop art and build/fund self-sufficient communities for seniors, disabled and the houseless.

            <center><h5>Guardian & Hero - Senior Care Village</h5></center><br>
            Inspired by The HogeweykÂ®, a Dutch Dementia Village in the Netherlands and the french Alzheimer's village "Landais" in southwestern France. Is a concept for a self-sufficient, gated community comprised of interconnected Tiny Homes and Cottages, with homes for off-duty staff and housing for up to 6-7 residents and a caregiver. A single village would utilize a combination of employees and volunteers to keep it going. A small farm run by the monks would be on-site, vending machines, a supermarket without prices, labels or cash registers. People would travel by bike or foot instead of gas-powered vehicles. Medical staff would wear regular clothes, disguised as helpful neighbors and friends. In the village residents would not be seen as at the end of their life, but as undergoing a continuous evolution from one stage to the next, the ability to flourish and grow from beginning to end. A daycare facility could be offered for working staff members and visiting families. Residents could take art courses, eat their meals at restaurants or take it home. There would be security on staff to prevent abuse, and more.
            <p>
            Our target audience would be people both with and <i>without</i> long-term care insurance. Staff would be offered room and board on-site, but still separate for when they are off-duty. Free and low-cost food, a place for child-care and education for their children. As well as full-benefits (dental, vision and insurance). If they have a parent or grandparent in need of care, those relatives could receive care as well. It could run like a well-oiled cruise ship.
            </p>
            <p>
            We could partner with food organizations, food pantries, and farmers to offer fresh produce and food that actually taste good. If this concept is successful we would eventually like to develop blueprints for dealing with the Homeless crisis, Group homes and facilities for those with disabilities. It would offer a continuum of care, tackling transitional living, residential care, and services for families and children.</p>
            <p>
            Currently there are a few challenges to consider. We will need Architects, Nurses and CNAs, a minimum of 35 acres, and Funding to make this work, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. We would have to start small, as an experimental start-up and prototype to show it could be successful. At this stage we are asking questions on what it would take to get something like this designed, funded and off the ground.
