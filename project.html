            Guardian & Hero Nation is a tribal fellowship and ethnoreligious nation consisting of practitioners from various faiths and philosophies. Together they formulate blueprints for a nomadic, self-sustaining, monastic community where Members travel together or alone by horse, wagon, or other sustainable vehicle such as pack and draft animals, cargo ebikes and tents, and other portable tiny homes. They migrate to places where they wild camp in groups among the wilds of nature away from organized campsites and cities, moving every so often as required by law. They generate their own electricity, grow food, collect rainwater and work together to build or acquire portable, tiny, sustainable homes and the means to transport them from one place to another.

        <div class="cell small-6 textpadding">
            <b>Guardians</b> are predominately eclectic Buddhists, Neo-Pagans and Shamans. While each Guardian has their own beliefs, they share a set of overlapping beliefs that allow them to achieve a common goal and share a lifestyle. Each Guardian is ordained into the lineage by accordance to the founding house and may refer to themselves as Priestesses, Guardian Monks or Shamans. All guardians practice celibacy as "the abstination of marriage" to any individual, instead marrying themselves to the divine, higher consciousness and purpose. Guardians receive a living allowance or stipend and take a vow of poverty, supporting themselves by providing products and services in alignment with their philosophies and then reinvest their profits into building and sustaining the Guardian & Hero Nation.

They provide products and services in alignment with philosophies that are unique to themselves while also serving others.

The majority of layman are independent and self-supporting, but some make arrangements that allow them to be supported by the Guardians without taking monastic vows. The term Hero is also used to refer to children of Guardians who come of age and decide they do not wish to be part of the Guardians but  desire to support and be supported by the Guardians, remaining part of the Guardian family and community.
